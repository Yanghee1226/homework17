    <h>I'M YANGHEE ESTHER KIM</h>
     <p>
                My name is Yanghee Esther Kim and I am currently studying at University of California Irvine to learn in-depth in UI/UX and looking for a career opportunity in the design industry.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a designer, by simplifying the complex processes for the users is at my utmost goal. I am passionate about creating innovative solutions to show the users a thoughtful and meaningful experiences to elevate their experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the simple reasons why I love design is through everyday learning. By learning something new everyday, I can optimize, improve and have a more effective process. By constantly being curious about how and why things are made the way they are for what purpose is the questions that I ask myself during design process. I will be inquisitive and always be asking, “WHY…?”

          <h2> 3 FACTS ABOUT ME </h2>
          <p1> 
            1. When I have free time, I enjoy building Gunpla (Gundam figures). I started building Gunpla a year after I graduated college in reminisce of model making.
          </p1>
          
          <p1>
             2.	I think coffee taste awful. The only time I would drink is when I need to stay all night. And when I do, I can never finish a cup of coffee.
          </p1>
          
          <p1>
            3.	At work, I always type out what to say on Microsoft Word before calling a customer. This prevents me from speaking more fluently.
